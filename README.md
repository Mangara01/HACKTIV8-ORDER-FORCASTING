# Order Forcasting

## Background

In today's competitive business environment, efficient order management plays a pivotal role in ensuring customer satisfaction and cost optimization. A critical component of effective order management is the accurate daily forecasting of demand, which impacts inventory control, production planning, and resource allocation. This challenge is especially pronounced in industries characterized by dynamic and unpredictable demand, such as e-commerce and retail.

Historically, businesses have relied on simple forecasting techniques and historical data, but these methods often fall short in the face of modern market complexities. This data science project leverages advanced techniques to create robust demand forecasting models that adapt to changing market dynamics.

## Objective

The primary objective of this data science project is to develop a highly accurate and adaptable daily demand forecasting system for order management.

## Machine Learning Models

The machine learning used in this project is linear regression.
